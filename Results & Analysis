📊 Results & Analysis

Baseline model: 99.32 % accuracy on clean data
Under FGSM (ε = 0.1): accuracy drops to 7.96 %
After 5 rounds of unlearning: 96.69 % accuracy recovered
Robustness gain: +88.7 % improvement without full retraining


🧭 Future Work

Extend the framework to PGD, DeepFool, and CW attacks.
Apply the method to Transformer and ResNet architectures.
Incorporate federated unlearning for distributed security.
Optimize the pipeline with parallel algorithms (OpenMP / CUDA) for large datasets.
